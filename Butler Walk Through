This is my first write up

This Vulnerable by design VM is provided by TCM Acamdemy as part of the Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course

I had to change Network cards to NAT, also for some reason this VM was dual honed, however, this is not relevant for this VM. 

Nnce VM booted, I had to log in and run (creds are provided in a text file byt TCM)
```markdown
DHClient
```


Then run Netdiscover to get target IP, for me.
```markdown
sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.22.0/24
```
I find our target VM
192.168.22.136
Next step is to run NMAP
```markdown
sudo nmap -A -p- -T4 192.168.22.136
